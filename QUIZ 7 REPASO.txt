ANGELINA JOLIE AND TOM CRUISE ARE SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD. WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE ACTOR/ACTRESS? WHO IS HE/SHE? IN WHAT MOVIES HAS HE/SHE ACTED AND WHAT DO YOU THING ABOUT THAT MOVIE?

My favorite actor is Jim Carrey. He is an actor in his sixties who was born in Canada. He has appeared as an amusing person in his movies for different American film companies, which are very popular in Hollywood.

He acted in The Mask, Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Grinch, and Bruce Almighty. All of these movies are amazing for me, except Ace Ventura. I felt embarrassed when I saw that movie because it was very ridiculous.

In comedy movies like The Mask and Liar Liar, he seemed very excited about his advantages in each story, and a little surprised by his abilities to manage them. But during the rest of the movie he was very relaxed, inspiring, and amusing.


I don’t have a favorite actress, but I would choose Cameron Diaz.
My favorite actress is Cameron Diaz. She is an actress in her fifties who was born in the United States. She has appeared as an amusing and charming person in her movies for different American film companies, which are very popular in Hollywood.

She acted in The Mask with Jim Carrey, Charlie’s Angels, and she lent her voice to Shrek. She seemed innocent and motivated at the beginning of each movie that I have seen. But later, she appears brave during the story. Her fans feel motivated to watch her movies, which are very popular today.

In Shrek, for example, she played a charming princess called Fiona. Although Shrek rescues her, she is very fascinating when she meets him. Her personality inspires a lot of confidence, and she has similar tastes to Shrek, who rescues her and falls in love with her.


A TRADITIONAL ACTION MOVIE HAS A HERO AND A VILLAIN. WHT IS A HERO? WHAT IS A VILLAIN? WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ACTION MOVIES?

A hero is a brave person who helps other people and fights for what is right. A villain is a bad person who tries to hurt or steal from others, or wants power to dominate something.

I think action movies are very exciting if the movie has an original story with a few special effects. The hero appears as an inspired and determined person, dedicated to protecting others, and the corrupted and twisted villain can even be a favorite character for the public.

On the other hand, movies with many special effects are boring. They don’t offer the realism of a simple and original story, which can win fans over time.


TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE, WHY YOU LIKE IT, WHO THE PROTAGONISTS ARE, WHAT IT IS ABOUT, ETC.

My favorite movie is Pulp Fiction, which was directed by Quentin Tarantino in 1994. I like it because it is very amazing and the story is exciting.

The main characters are Vincent Vega, a relaxed but sometimes terrified gangster; Jules Winnfield, a terrified and religious gangster; Mia Wallace, an irritated woman who likes Vincent; and Butch Coolidge, a tempted boxer who wants to win money.

The movie has several stories which connect at some points. First, the gangsters have to finish a job and pick up a portfolio with curious contents. The situation is very worrying when they accidentally kill someone and are threatened by an anxious person.

Mia Wallace meets Vincent for dinner. She accidentally uses heroin, and Vincent, who is very worried, helps her.

Finally, Butch has to fight, but he decides to win. He escapes with the money with his girlfriend, who is charming but a little careless. She forgets Butch’s favorite watch, which he had since childhood. He is very disgusted, but decides to find it.

PART B
TALK ABOUT THE RULES PEOPLE FOLLOW AT A MOVIE THEATER AND SOME BODY GESTURES THEY DO WHEN THEY LIKE OR DON'T LIKE A MOVE

In a movie theater, people have to follow some rules. You have to buy a ticket before watching the movie. You can’t talk loudly or use your phone during the movie. You can eat popcorn, but some theaters don’t allow to bring food. You must throw your trash in the trash can.

Sometimes, people show that they like a movie with gestures. They may clap their hands, smile, or say “wow!” They might laugh when something is funny. If they don’t like the movie, they probably roll their eyes, shake their head, or even leave the cinema.

When someone asks me what a gesture means, I can say: “That must mean they liked the movie” or “Maybe it means they are bored.” If someone laughs, it definitely means they enjoy the story.


WHEN PEOPLE GO TO HOSPITALS THERE ARE SOME RULES THAT HEY NEED TO FOLLOW. WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE RULES? ADDITIONALLY, WHEN DOCTORS EXAMINE CHILDREN THERE ARE SOME GESTURES AND BODY LANGUAGE THAT CAN HELP THE DOCTOR UNDERSTAND THEM WHT GESTURES COULD HELP A DOCTOR AND WHAT DO THEY MEAN?

When people go to hospitals, they have to follow some rules. You have to wear a mask in some hospitals. You must wash your hands before and after visiting a patient. You can’t eat in the hospital rooms, and you can’t make loud noises. You can bring small gifts for patients, but some hospitals don’t allow flowers.

When doctors examine children, gestures and body language are very important. If a child smiles and looks relaxed, it probably means they feel comfortable. If a child cries or hides, it might mean they are afraid or in pain. If a child points to their stomach or head, it definitely means that they feel something in that part of their body. Doctors also use gestures, like showing a toy or making funny faces, to help children feel relaxed.


IN THE PAST, MOVIES DIDN'T HAVE SOUND, SO ACTORS HAD TO EXPRESS EVERYTHING WITH BODY LANGUAGE OR VISUAL SIGNS. WHAT EXPRESSIONS DO YOU THINK THEY USED? WHAT ARE THEIR MEANINGS? WHAT ARE SOME COMMON SIGNS THAT WE ALSO SEE EVERY DAY ON THE STREETS?

In the past, movies didn’t have sound, so actors had to use their bodies and faces to show feelings. If an actor smiled a lot, it probably meant happiness. If an actor shook their head or frowned, it might mean sadness or anger. If they opened their eyes wide and put their hands on their cheeks, it definitely meant surprise.

Actors also waved to say hello, bowed to show respect, and pointed to show important things. These gestures were very amazing because people could understand the story without words.

Today, we see similar gestures on the streets. People smile when they are happy, wave to friends, shake their heads to say no, and point to show directions. These gestures must mean something important because everyone can understand them.
